# Website Rework
- Keep refreshed (new/wavy) design which is very good
- Update information and pictures to be newer 
  - Add robot information for pre-2013 robots and 2023/2024 BunnyBots
  - Add robot reveal, CAD, and awards/competitions for all robots where those things exist
- List of things to add:
  - Add Digital Dragons to About SERT page 
  - Update Team picture on Our Team page to be newer)
  - Edit (or remove?) downloads page 
  - ROBOTS PAGE!!
    - Add older robots (pre-2013)
      - Ask mentors about what happened then/why there isn't anything older
      - Also why did so many things start in 2014? It seems like it was kinda like the start of the team for some reasson
    - Info about attended competitions and awards
    - Photos (all of them should have one, some should be better too (Chi is an example, it doesn't really show the robot))
    - Better descriptions

## Goals:
- Learn about team's history
- Make website more up-to-date and accurate
