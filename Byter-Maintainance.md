# Byter Maintainance/Rebuilding
## Goals 
 - Make it so that new software members can practice coding for an actual robot
   - Byter is significantly simpler to understand how it works (aside from the arm, which I'm planning to ask Ben about), so new members will have an easier time learning about robot coding practices
   - Marvin will also be able to do this, but it is a more complex robot (for more experinced members)
 - Give Electrical practice with systems that they're less familiar with (Jaguars, Pneumatics, PWM things?)
 - Learn about how older robots were designed/constucted and learn from this
## Tasks
- Examine, repair, and test Byter
  - Replace cRio with the RRoboRio with broken USB
    - Talk with Electrical about if it would be possible to use cRio
      - I doubt it's possible since it was directly discouraged by a 2974 mentor, also it would make thigns more complicated
  - Make sure motors all spin and Jaguars all work
