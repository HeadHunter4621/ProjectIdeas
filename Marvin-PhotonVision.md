# Marvin PhotonVision Setup
Use ArduCams and PhotonVision to test different types of vision software
## Goals
- Mount ArduCams and BeeLink to Marvin to run PhotonVison
  - Give software practice with working with Linux(BeeLink), other tools that we aren't familiar with
## Parts Required: 
- Marvin (free?)
- ArduCams (we have them already)
  - Mounts already exist and are mounted on Marvin
- BeeLink and power adapter (we have BeeLinks but I'm unsure about how it's powered)
