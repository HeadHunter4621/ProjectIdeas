# Byter Maintenance/Rebuilding
## Goals 
 - Make it so that new software members (everyone except for me and Benji) can practice coding for an actual robot
   - Byter is significantly simpler to understand how it works (aside from the arm, which I'm planning to ask Ben about), so new members will have an easier time learning about robot coding practices
 - Give mechanical experience with pneumatucs
   - Marvin will also be able to do this, but it is a more complex robot (for more experienced members)
 - Give Electrical practice with systems that they're less familiar with (Jaguars, Pneumatics, PWM things?)
 - Learn about how older robots were designed/constructed and learn from this
## Tasks
- Examine, repair, and test Byter
  - Replace cRio with the RoboRio with broken USB (it will be removed by the end of the offseason so we won't have to buy a new one)
  - Make sure motors all spin and Jaguars all work
