# Byter Maintenance/Rebuilding
## Goals 
 - Make it so that new software members can practice coding for an actual robot
   - Byter is significantly simpler to understand how it works (aside from the arm, which I'm planning to ask Ben about), so new members will have an easier time learning about robot coding practices
   - Marvin will also be able to do this, but it is a more complex robot (for more experienced members)
 - Give Electrical practice with systems that they're less familiar with (Jaguars, Pneumatics, PWM things?)
 - Learn about how older robots were designed/constructed and learn from this
## Tasks
- Examine, repair, and test Byter
  - Replace cRio with the RoboRio with broken USB ( it will be removed by the end of the offseason so we won't have to buy a new one)
    - Talk with Electrical about if it would be possible to use cRio
      - I doubt it's possible since it was directly discouraged by a 2974 mentor, also it would make things more complicated
  - Make sure motors all spin and Jaguars all work
