# Marvin Demo Improvements
## Tasks:
### Code:
- Rewrite all code to work better for demos
  - Simpler Constants.kt file for easier at-demo modification of code (such as flywheel speed, driving speed, etc.)
  - Easier-to-understand control scheme
  - Fast mode
    - Makes Marvin move at much higher speed so that I (or other SERT member) can show how cool swerve is
      - Complicated button combination (Pressing both sticks like buttons) to toggle
         - Resets to normal after disable or doing the button thing again
- Teach other people who will often be at demos how to control and set up Marvin
### Bumpers:
- Make new bumpers that are purple and sat SERT rather than 2521
  - Front bumper can be mounted higher up to make intaking from the ground more reliable!!
  - More durable material?

## Money/Parts Required:
Free (just time with the robot) or the resources required for more bumpers (will talk with Mechanical about this at some point)

## Goals:
- Better Demo Code
- More Reliable Bumpers/Ground Intake

## Possible alternative project:
Every year, have all new members (with experienced members' guidance) re-code Marvin. This is good because it leads to more experience with coding a robot, and we will need to code it again every year because of WPILib changes that happen every year. It will show everyone how these changes are used (which would have been helpful this year because the way SparkMaxes are configured changed significantly, and we didn't know how it worked for a long time)
