# Marvin PhotonVision Setup
Use ArduCams and PhotonVision to test different types of vision software
## Goals
- Mount ArduCams and BeeLink to Marvin to run PhotonVision
  - Give software practice with working with Linux (BeeLink), other tools that we aren't familiar with (MRCal, PhotonVision, ArduCam)
  - Run pose estimation for Reefscape field? Unsure exactly
## Parts Required: 
- Marvin (free?)
  - Needs repairs at the moment (replace PoE)
- ArduCams (we have them already, not sure if we have enough though)
  - Mounts already exist and are mounted on Marvin
- BeeLink and power adapter (we have BeeLinks but I'm unsure about how it's powered, also need to figure out radio wiring)
