# Note/Journaling system
Inspired by Scarlet's system

## Done:
- Apple Shortcuts/Action Button thing to add note to a notes

## To Do:
- Last.FM Python thing
  - Get Last.FM history from the day and convert it to raw text
    - `[HH:mm:ss] Song: songName (artist)` 
      - `songName` = name of the song 
      - `artist` = name of the artist
    - System to print the text in this format works, but I don't know how to use Last.FM's API
- BlueSky Posts?
  - New idea, fetch text from BlueSky posts from the day and turn them into text
    - `[HH:mm:ss] BSKY Post: postText`
      - Time is the time when it was posted
      - `postText` is the exact text from the post
