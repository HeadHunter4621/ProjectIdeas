### This is hard to explain and I just need something to do during class lol
# Steps
- Choose what Apple Music playlists I want to transfer 
  - 2025 Spring (50 songs)
  - Cafe (27 songs)
  - Camping Playlist(~1500 songs)
- Use some system to transfer them to YouTube 
  - Available Options:
    - TuneMyMusic
      - Limited to 200 songs
      - Used for 2 smaller playlists but not large one 
    - Soundiiz
      - Can be used but costs $5 per month (would only pay once but still annoying_)
    - https://support.google.com/youtubemusic/answer/14729358?hl=en#zippy=%2Capple-music This is interesting
- Use YT-DLP to download the playlists to NAS (in separate folders)
  - Need to figure out filetype changing, destination setting, etc.
- Configure iTunes to use NAS as file server (or something like that)
