# Marvin Demo Improvements
- Code:
  - Rewrite all code to work better for demos
    - Simpler Constants.kt file for easier at-demo modification of code (such as flywheel speed, driving speed, etc)
    - Easier-to-understand control scheme
    - Fast mode
        - Makes Marvin move at much higer speed so I (or other SERT member) can show how cool swerve is
        - Complicated button combination (Pressing both sticks like buttons) to toggle
          - Resets to normal after disable or doing the button thing again
  - Teach other people who will often be at demos how to control and set up Marvin
- Bumpers:
  - Make new bumpers that are purple and sat SERT rather than 2521
    - Front bumper can be mounted higher up to make intahing from the ground more reliable!!
    - More furable material?

## Money/Parts Required:
Free (just time with the robot) or the resources required for more bumpers (will talk with Mechanical about this at some point)

## Goals:
- Better Demo Code
- More Reliable Bumpers/Ground Intake
